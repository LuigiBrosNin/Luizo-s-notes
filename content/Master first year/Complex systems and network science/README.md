# Introduction
An implementation of three agent-based models for a prey and predator system aimed at studying the impacts of the chosen parameters in the simulation such as vision range, speed, population, reproduction rate and communication range. The three models implement a basic environment, a self-organizing schooling system for fishes and a hunting communication network for dolphins. The results show how each affect the simulation, and in particular how survival is dictated by prevention instead of fleeing, or how communication makes hunting more consistent, but does not make predators better overall at hunting.

# Loading the models into NetLogo
The models are written in [NetLogo 6.4](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml), which is required to run the models.
In NetLogo, go to `File > Open` (or `Ctrl + O`) and open t
